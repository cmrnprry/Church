}

There's eight pews, two columns, with four pews each. You seach from front to back, left to right. You feel underneath and the back to make sure nothing is glued or taped to it. You move slowly and methodically, making sure you don't miss anything. 

You don't find much of anything. With a huff you plop onto the last pew you searched, taking a well deserved break. You close your eyes and rub your face. What are you even looking for?

You lean back in your seat, eyes still closed. There's no use sitting here.

}

You hear a church organ begin to play, and your eyes snap open. You look around to see the pews filled with people. You can't make out any face or distiguishing mark, just the gernal shape of people. Their image flickers in and out of view. They sit next to you, but don't acknowledge you.

What you think is a priest climbs the stage and begins to address the crowd. You can't understand what's being said. It sounds more like grunts and groans than language.

*[Get up]
->Pews.Get_Up

*[Stay seated]

- You stay seated, only half listening to the sound. You look at the "people" sitting near you, trying to see if you can make anything out. They're not fully translucent. You can see throught their edges, but the center is opaque, almost like a thick black smoke.

*[Touch the person next to you]
~ temp_bool = true
    Curiosity gets the best of you, and you attempt to touch the arm of the person next to you. Your hand passes right through them, and feels like you stuck your hand into a blast chiller.

    The figure growls something gutteral, and turns toward you. The freezing cold becomes painful as it rapidly grows colder. You quickly pull your arm back, and begin to try to warm it up. "Sorry! Sorry!"

    The figure growls again, and moves further away from you. You don't think you should do that again.

- You stay in your seat, hoping it ends soon. You focus on the back of the seat in front of you. A bible is held in the pocket attached to the back of it.

Reading it will probably pass the time, but you can also still sneak away.

*[Open the bible]

->Pews.Get_Up

- You reach for the bible, when a red spotlight land on you. You freeze. It's the light from the window behind the priest, and gives off the same {temp_string} feeling as before. { leave_light: It warms your body, and some of the tension melts away.} { leave_light == false: Your skin tingles under it's warmth. It's uncomfortable. } 

"Ah, there... you... are..." The pastor says, each word drawn out and emphasized. It's voice is raspy and harsh, like it's not used to speaking human language. 

The pastor on stage is beckoning you to join him. All eyes are on you. { leave_light: You fidget with your clothing, not sure what to do with your hands. You feel like a child getting called on in class when you don't knwo the answer.} { leave_light == false: A bead of sweat rolls down your back.

You wave your hands in front of you, shake your head, and try to leave. The light follows your movements as you exit into the aisle. As you turn to walk opposite the stage, the pastor stands in your path.

"How did you-?"

"Wrong way... The stage is... this way."

The pastor grabs you by the shoulders, and leads you to the stage. { leave_light: "The pastors hands are cold, as it guides you, but the warmth from the light counters it." } { leave_light == false: "You try to worm your way out, but he holds his grip tight. his icy hands growing colder the more you try to resist." }

The pastor pushes you up the stage, and stand next to you. It grabs your hand and raises it to the air. It says something in that gutteral language, then laughs. The rest of the church does as well. { stay >= 1.5: You nervously laugh along. } { stay < 1.5: You grit your teeth. }

You exit into the aisle, and slowly make your way to the stage. No one here has a face or eyes, but you can feel their stares boring into you. The light follows your movements as you approach the stage.

You make it to the stage, and stand next to the ghostly pastor. It grabs your hand and raises it to the air. It says something in that gutteral language, then laughs. The rest of the church does as well. { stay >= 1.5: You nervously laugh along. } { stay < 1.5: You grit your teeth. }

"What is-" You try to ask, but the pastor once again grabs you and moves you to be center stage. Another person appears, wheeling over a cart that has a container of water on it. Their left hand is missing a few fingers. The paster grabs something from behind the podium. "Can you explain to me what's-"

"Now, which hand...?" It asks, hands behind it's back.

"Hand? For what?!"

"Left or right?"

{ temp_string == "": "I'm not doing <i>anything</i> until you tell me <i>what is going on!</i>" You borderline shout. } 

"Cleanse. You... need to be... willing..." The pastor tilts it's head to the side. It's voice sounds more threatening than it did a moment ago. "Now, hand."

You look at the tub of water in front of you.

->Pews.Refuse_Him

- You assume this will just be some hand washing ritual, and hold out your hand over the container of water. The pastor takes you by the wrist, and gently places it in the water. The crowd begins to chant. 

"Hold it... there. Don't move." It says something to the crowd, and they raise a hand. Some raise two. All of them are missing at least one finger on the raised hand. "It will only... hurt a bit..."

"Hurt? What do you-?" Before you can finish speaking, it begins reciting something. It pulls his free hand from behind it's back, and reveals a pair of wire cutters. "Waitwaitwaitwait-!" 

You try to pull back, but it's grip becomes like steel. It smiles at you. "Thank you..." it explaims and in one swift motion, cuts off one of your fingers with a sickening <i>crunch.</i> 

It releases you. 

* [You stumble back.]

= Finger_Gone
~ finger_chopped = true
Your hand is pouring blood. You're screaming, you think. Everything is moving in slow motion as you scramble backwards. You don't know where you're going, just that you need to get away.

The pastor walks toward you, finger in one hand, wire cutters in the other. It doesn't have a face but you know it's smiling manically. Your back eventually reaches a wall, and it crouches in front of you. "Hush... Hush... Hush..." it consoles you. "It only hurts... for a minute.

Your scream becomes a wimper as you wait for the pain to pass.

*[It never does]
~ stay -= 1
~ temp_bool = false
    The pain never dies, continuing to be a harsh, pulsating pain. "It won't go away... unless you let it." the pastor growls. "You need... to be willing."

    You furiously shake your head. "Fine fine fine fine fine FINE!" The paster throws the wire cutters to the ground, and stamps it's feet in a tantrum. "Have it... YOUR way, then." 

    You watch in horror as he tilts it head back and slowly lowers your finger into it not face. You hear the sound of crunching as it chews, and you feel each, and every crunch. You gasp in pain as it loudly gulps, then looks at you again.

*[At some point, it does]
~ stay += 1
~ temp_bool = true
~ happy = true
    You don't know how long it takes, but eventually the pain dies to a dull throbbing. "There, you see?" the pastor says. "Now, be at peace."

    You watch in horror as it tilts it's head back and slowly lowers your finger into it's not face. You hear the sound of crunching as it chews, and as he does you feel lighter and lighter. It loudly gulps as it finishes, then looks at you again.

- "There, not so bad, was it?"

*[You shake your head.]

{ temp_bool: It reaches out, and pulls you into a standing position. You craddle your fingerless hand. The pastor gently holds you, and brings you back to the main stage. It dips your hand in the water again before pulling out a bandage, and carefully wrappying up your finger stump. The crowd claps. <br><br> "Now... let us bow our heads... and pray." The crowd bows their heads, and you follow suit. <br><br> The pastor says a prayer in the non-human language, but, strangely enough, you think you understand it. Not fully, not like you could translate it, but more... innately. You could not speak this language, but understand the meaning in the words. <br><br> When it finishes you look up, smiling, only to see you are alone on stage. The crowd is gone. All that's left of the encounter is the wire cutters sitting on the floor where the pastor had been standing, and a dull pain where your finger used to be. }


{ temp_bool == false: It rips off a piece of cloth, dabs it's not mouth with it, and throws it at you.

The prayer stops, and you look up, afraid of what will come next, only to see that it is gone. The crowd is gone.

You take another look at the water, then the pastor. "No, I think I'm okay." 

The pastor lets out a deep, gutteral growl. "Fine then." He snaps his head to crowd, and points at a woman in the second row. "Your turn then." 

A woman floats to the stage, and stands next you. She looks at you, and though she doesn't have a face, you can sense of deep fear in her. She looks back to the pastor, who is holding out it's hand, waiting for hers. 

"Please..." she wimpers. "I have- I've already been cleansed."

The pastor ignores her and grabs her arm, forcing it over the container of water. She looks at you. She is pleading.

- "Wait!" You reach out, and stop the pastor. It cocks it's head to the side. "I'll do it."

"You are... willing, then?"

It releases the woman, grabs your wrist. She falls to her feet, thanking you, before returning to her seat.

*["Yes."]
"Hold still..." It turns to the crowd, and they begin to chant. "It will only... hurt a bit..."

"Hurt? What do you-?" Before you can finish speaking, it begins reciting something. It pulls his free hand from behind it's back, and reveals a pair of wire cutters. "Waitwaitwaitwait-!" 

You try to pull back, but it's grip becomes like steel. It smiles at you. "Thank you..." it explaims and in one swift motion, cuts off one of your fingers with a sickening <i>crunch.</i>

"You've made... your choice..." The pastor turns to the crowd, and they begin to chant.

The pastor recites something. It pulls his free hand from behind his back, and reveals a pair of wire cutters. The woman is pleading with him. With you.

*[You do nothing to stop it.]

- 
"Coward." she spits at you, before the pastor uses the cutters to cut off one of the woman's fingers with a sickening <i>crunch.</i> She falls to the ground, cradling her injured hand. You see that her other hand is also missing fingers.

The pastor places the wire cutter on the tray with the container of now bloodied water. The crowd claps. "Now... let us bow our heads... and pray." The crowd bows their heads.

She looks up at you sobbing. "After everything I've done for you? This is how you repay me?"

You feel sick, and stumble backwards. {name: <i>Ophelia...?</i>}{name == false: <i>Is she...?</i>}

    You turn away from her, unable to face her.
