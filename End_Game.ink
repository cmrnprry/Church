=== Open_the_Door ===
The door opens with a groan. The walls are bare, and the ceiling is low. The room inside is cramped, with a knee high table in the center. On the table is a glass, and bread. Behind it, an ornate bowl with a glowing, stained glass heart inside.

"The heart...?"

You duck into the room and the door closes behind you, but you don't bother looking back. You approach the table, and sit in front of it. The heart is about the size of your fist. It floats in a small bowl of water, and is the source of the red glow. The glass is filled with a deep, red liquid. The bread next to it is short and stubby. It looks soft under the light of the heart.

Your mouth begins to water and your stomach growls. When was the last time you ate? drank?

*[Consume what's on the table]

= Consume
You pick up the glass, and sniff the liquid. It smells like grapes. 

*[Take a sip]

*[Put it back]
You decide against it. You can always eat after you escape.
-> Open_the_Door.Pick_Up

- You take a small sip. It's <pundgent, tangy, sweet, delicious>. You can't stop yourself from gluping it down. Warm, thick liquid slides down your throat. 

*[You can't get enough.]

{
    - stay >= 2.5:
        ~temp_string = "bone"
    - else:
        ~temp_string = "[bone]"
}

Your stomach growls and you stop drinking, only long enough to take a breath, and snatch the bread from the table. You rip into it, tearing the flesh from the bone.

The bread is <chewy, soft, meaty, exquisite>. You can't chew fast enough, taking bigger and bigger bites, barely stopping to swallow. When it's gone, you lick the {temp_string} clean.

*[You need more.]

{
    - stay < 2.5:
        *[bone]
        ->Open_the_Door.Bone
}

- You look back to the table to see its covered in <bread, flesh>, and that your glass has filled itself back up with <wine, blood>. 

You keep eating and drinking, never satisified. Always needing more. 

*[And there is always more for you.]

= Bone
Bone...? 

The realization snaps you out it. Your hands shake as you look down at what's in your them. 

They're covered in the sticky, red liquid that is in the glass. The bread- What you had _thought_ was bread, is- It looks like- You drop the small bones and look at the plate. It's filled with finger sized pieces of bread- no. Not bread. It was _never_ bread. It's- 

You cover your mouth, and your stomach lurches. You turn away from the table and retch. Everything you ate and drank comes out is a acidic, red, chunky mess. You wipe your mouth with your sleeve, and bang you fist on the table.

You look back at the glowing heart.

Carefully, you reach out and take the heart out of the water. The church groans, and heart softly pulses in your hand.

You don't know what will happen to you or the church if you destroy the heart up here, and you don't really want to find out. You don't think the church will pull anything while your holding it's heart, but...

}

You hold onto the heart tightly, and leave the room. The door opens for you, and the stairs turn into a ramp leading back into the main body of the church. {temp_string}

*[The church is afraid.]

- You are at the front door. It opens, showing off the moonlit sidewalk of the outside world. The cool breeze blows in and you take a deep breath of the crsip, fresh air. 

You are so close to freedom.

You stand in the doorway. The heart pulses faster, matching your own. You look down at it.

*[Exit the church]
You step outside, into the real world, taking the heart with you. The church gates creak open, allowing you to fully leave it's grasp.

= Crush_it
Holding the heart in one hand, you begin to squeeze. It doesn't take much effort, almost like breaking an egg. The heart begins to bleed and pulse faster. The light begins to die.

The sound of a wounded animal reveberates through the room.

*[The church is in pain]

- It shakes. It pleads. It begs you to stop.

}


You think of everythign you went through becasue of the church. Of the church's sight. {temp_string} Of all the people who can never leave. Will never leave.

You squeeze harder, until your nails peirce your palm. The light is almost gone now. The church sqeaks pitifully in response. You drop whatever remains of the heart, and it falls to the floor with a wet <i>splat!</i>

        With one calm movement, you step outside the doorway, and though the gates.
        
        You watch the church groan and scream as it falls in on itself. It begins to glow so brightly that you shield your eyes. With one last cry, the light is gone, and when you look back, so is the church.

- You fall.

And fall.

And fall some more.

For what seems like forever.

*[Open your eyes.]

- Above you is a sky of stars. You are not falling, but laying in soft dirt.

You sit up and realize you are in an empty field of dirt. The place where a church once sat.

- You stand, and dust yourself off.

= Eat_it
The heart beats in your hand, a lovely red color. Almost like a sweet apple. You raise the heart to your lips.

Are you certain?

*[Take a bite]

- 
#play: shriek
The church shrieks in response. It shakes and shutters. The ghostly figures grab their heads in agony.

Cool, sweet juice slides down your face. Yes. It tastes just like an apple. The sweetest, crispest apple you've ever had.

Your body begins to feel a bit lighter. 

*[Take another bite.]

- The ghosts fall to their knees, reaching for you. They cry for you.

All your worries seemingly melt away. You're not even sure why you were fighting so hard to get out. You can barely feel anything. Even the taste is nothing more than a fleeting memory.

*[Finish the heart]

- You chew and chew until there's nothing left.

The heart is gone. 

You are gone.

*[You are the church.]

- 
*[And the church is you]
