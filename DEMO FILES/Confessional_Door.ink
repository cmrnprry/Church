You sit on the cold wooden bench. Just like the outside, the inside doesn't have many details. The grate that a priest would speak through has the same lattice work that the door does. 
        
You look around the crammed space and find nothing. The booth is empty. {confessional_sin: You already found a key earlier, what more could be in the booth?} { confessional_sin == false: You don't know what you were expecting. }

    You check the space again, doing your best to check every nook and cranny. Under the bench, in the corners, anywhere you can think. You don't find anything.

    You sigh. {confessional_sin: Maybe the key was the only thing you could find.} {confessional_sin == false: You should look elsewhere.}

"Oh!" She perks up immediately. "I kept miss-"

She is cut off by a coughing fit. Harsh, loud, wet coughs. 

*[Wait for her to stop]

*[Ask if she's alright]
    "Ye-" she tries to respond. "Ye-ah."

    "Deep breaths." You say. "We are in no rush."

    She tries to say something else, but the coughing fit persists.

- You wait, listening to the aggressive, wet coughs plaguing the girl on the other side. Eventually, she stops.

"Sorry," she wheezes. "I'm really sick... I was hoping that my dad was... He's a priest so..."

    You are <i>not</i> a priest, and certainly not a replacement for her father but... You want to be able to comfort her in some way.

- There's an uncomfortable silence before she speaks again.

"Since... Since I'm sick all time... sometimes I feel..." 

She's quiet for a moment. 

"I feel like a burden...." Your heart drops. "Mom is constantly praying, and Dad is always...."

She's quiet again. You don't know what to say.

*[Reassure her]

    "You are not a burden, and I'm sure your parents would be upset to here you say so." You try to keep your voice calm and comforting. "Everything they are doing is for you."

Your stomach drops. Here? <i>This</i> church? {confessional_sin: If her father is a pastor... Was he...?} Your mind races. Is it possible that...

*["What do you mean?"]
"<i>This</i> church?" The question comes out harsher than you mean to.

*["He doesn't come home?"]
"He used to, but-" She coughs. "But he hasn't in a really long-"

"And you always feel worse when you come to the church?" The question comes out harsher than you mean to.


- "Oh, uhm, well I don't-" She fumbles over her words. "I'm sorry did I say something wrong?"

You have many questions, but she is still a child. A sick child.

"Before that, can you tell me more about your dad not leaving the church?" You keep your voice polite. "After that we can talk all about your prayer habits, okay?"

"Well... He used to go once a week, to pray for me, at our old church. As I got sicker, he got recommended this one, and it was okay for a while. I got a little better, but he stopped coming home..." She sniffs. "I only see him if mom brings me here, but she only ever lets me talk to him from the gate. He didn't show up this time so I..." 

"You...?"

"I went inside."

A pit forms in your stomach. 

"I just want us to be together again! I pray for it all the time!" Her voice trembles with a mix of anger and misery. "How do I fix it? Please, tell me how to fix it!"

"He... thought you might visit! And... told me.... just in case!" It's pretty clear that you're lying, but you hope she buys it.

"Oh." Her voice is quiet. "I see..."

*[Did she buy it?]

- "Then... If I tell you-"

"Yes." you say, a little too fast.

"O-okay. I don't re-really know, but..." she clears her throat. "He told us he found it on his way home from our old church. It was new I think."

"It just showed up?" Your heart pounds.

"I guess it was newly built or something. The first time we went, I didn't remember it being in the area it was. It was on a road we would drive down sometimes to get to our old church."

You ball your fists. It's not the same as what happened to you, but it's similar enough.

*[They are also victims of the church.]

- "Thank you." You say, and lean back, closing your eyes. Your mind races as you process the information. What do you and this girl, no <i>family</i>, have in common? "That helps a lot."

"Mhm... Can you help me now...?" She is hopeful.

You're not a priest, and you are not entirely sure what the correct thing to say is, but you give it your best shot. "You are doing really well okay? So don't think you're not." You try to comfort her.
