=== Start ====
There is a church at the end of the street- but there shouldn't be. You saw it when walking home from the bus stop after work. You grew up on this street. You have walked down this road daily. There is not a church at the end of the street.

It was dark when you passed, and you keep telling youself that your tired brain mistook a billboard for a church. They must be building one there.

*[It's impossible for a church to spring up overnight.]

#IMAGE: BusStop
You pass by again, on your walk to the bus stop this morning, and stop dead in your tracks. There should not be a church, and yet, there it sits. A "FOR SALE" sign attached to its lawn.

*[You don't like it.]

*[You feel drawn to it.]

*[You want nothing to do with it]

- Your stomach churns.  You shove your hand in your pocket and rub your thumb over the worn polaroid picture inside.

*[You quickly cross the street.]

- You mess around on your phone, trying to ignore the building. You keep looking up at it, confiriming for yourself that the church is really there. 

It was not there on the walk to the bus stop yesterday, or the day before- you're sure of it. And a new building wouldn't look so... You glance up at it again, and something pulls at the back of your mind.

The church feels...

*[Familiar]
~feeling = "familiar"

*[Uncomfortable]
~feeling = "uncomfortable"

*[Evocative]
~feeling = "evocative"

- It is small, with white paint peeling, revealing sun-bleached brick underneath. It's windows are intact, but everything else is cracked or crumbling. You're surprised the building is still standing.

The bus arrives and you're no closer to understanding this {feeling} church that spontaneously appeared. Your stomach lurches.

*[Get on the bus]

=== Investigate

You pat your pant pockets, pretending that you forgot your pass, and smile sheepishly. The driver rolls her eyes and drives off. It's still early enough where you can just catch the next one. You steel yourself and look back at the church.

*[The church windows catch your eye.]

#ZOOM: scale(1.5) translate(-26%, 22%)|inset(0 0 32.5% 50%) #ICLASS: Background Image||Swimming
The church's windows are of stained glass, which isn't uncommon for it to have. You squint trying to make the image out, but no matter how hard you focus, you can't explain what the glass was a picture of. 

*[You take a step forward.]

You stumble backwards as the bus swerves, narrowly avoiding you. The driver opens the door and asks if you're alright. You feel youself nodding, heart pounding. A knot forms in your stomach.

*[Your eyes don't leave the church.]

- You brush off the driver's questions and board the bus.

*[Take a seat]
    You drift to the back of the bus, and sit where you can look at the church through the window.
    -> Bus.Seat
    
*["Do you know when they built that church?"]

- The bus driver gives you a look.

"Is that really important right now?" he says. "Are you alright?"

*["So it was here yesterday?"]

- You grip his arm as you ask. Your nails dig into his arm and he winces.

#CYCLE: perturbed, afraid, nervous, tense
"I'm going to need you to let go." He looks @. "Do I need to call someone?"

Your eyes dart from him to the church behind him and back. You're losing it. Over a building. You need to calm down.

"I'm sorry-" You release the bus driver. "I- I-'m sorry."

*[You scurry to the back of the bus.]
    You find a seat where you can look at the church through the window.

You board the the bus, and scan your ticket.

"I assume as much." She closes the bus doors.

*["How long have you been working this bus route?"]
"Too long. You should know, I see you almost daily." She closes the bus doors.

You jump and look up to see a coworker from your departmenr. You don't talk to her often, but she's nice enough. She looks... concerned?

*["Just sending out some scans."]

*["Busy work until the next meeting. You know how it is."]

*["Trying to keep busy."]

- She nods slowly, and picks up one of the papers from your done pile. "And... <i>this</i> is what you're sending out?"

"Yeah, Marketing needed-"

She cuts you off as she starts to read off what's on the page. "'Do you know about the church at the end of the street?" 

The hairs on the back of your neck stand up.

*[<i>No</i>]

- "The church at the end of the street knows me but I don't know it." She continues. Your chest tightens, and you frantically go through the rest of the papers. You know these were marketing reports. "It waits and waits for me to come back. It has gotten impatient."

All the papers repeat what you coworker said. Over and over again. All in handwriting. <i>Your</i> handwriting. You clutch the papers tightly, until your knuckles go white and your nails pierce through. <i>When did they change?</i>

"Did you write this?" She purses her lips at you. "Is this your idea of a bad joke?"

"Knock knock, can I talk to you?" You look up to see your supervisor at your door, holding a few sheets of paper. They look upset.

    They enter, and close the door, "I'll be quick. Can you explain what your last email meant?" They sound frustrated. "Is it a joke? A prank?"

    "Right..." they say, and enter anyway. "Can you explain what your last email meant? Our client is not happy."

- 

*["What?"]

*["They sent the email to the wrong department so..."]

- They roll their eyes and drop the papers on your desk. "You're about to lose us our best client!" You pick them up, and your stomach drops. In your hands is are print outs of emails from you to a client. They all say the same text over and over again:

"Do you know about the church at the end of the street? The church at the end of the street knows me but I don't know it. It waits and waits for me to come back. It has gotten impatient."

"Do you understand how this can hurt sales?" They hiss. You clutch the papers until your knuckles go white, and your nails pierce through. "You'd be <i>lucky</i> if I only suspend you for this!"

"Hey are you-" A hand grabs your shoulder, and you jump up from your chair, slaping the hand away.

Your mouth goes dry.

*[Scroll down]

- Under the image is the text "Don't keep it waiting."

You slam the laptop shut. A fuzzy memory tickles the back of your mind, and suddenly it all clicks into place.

*[You know the church.]

- You don't know how, but you know it. You slam you fist against your desk. "Why can't I...?" You mutter.

The memory refuses to surface, only vague images and feelings. You see yourself inside. You're scared. You're trapped. But that's all you can remember. You hit the desk again, harder. 

"It's right there, so just..." You murmer to yourself. "I was...?"

You found something. It let you out? No. It wouldn't-

*["Everything... Okay...? In here?"]

- It's your coworker. You wave him away, and focus. You escaped. It wants you back. You can see the door opening, but the younger you didn't feel relief. No, they felt... afraid? Why...? You got out so why-

Your coworker grabs your sholder, "Hey what's-" You jump up from your chair and smack his hand away. You lean on the wall to support yourself, breathing heavy. "What's your problem?!"

Your coworker stares at you, waiting for an answer. You shove your hand into your pocket, searching for the poleroid inside, hoping to calm yourself.

"No no no, where...?" You franticly searching every pocket, only to find it all empty. You look to your desk and find small, ripped pieces of a once comforting memory. "Did I...?"

"Seriously, what's up with you?!" You gather the pieces in your hands, and begin trying to tape them together, but the pieces are too small. You swallow the lump in your throat, and face your coworker. "Uhhh... You alright?"

Church?

About halfway down the steps, the smell of rot hits your nose, so strong you gag. {temp_string} and retch. The stench is unbareable. 

It smells of old, rotten meat left in the sun. Of putrid sour milk left out for too long. Of rancid fruit left to liquify in the fridge.

You cover your face with your shirt, and breathe through your mouth, but the pungent smell clings to you. 

*[Keep moving]

*[Turn back]
    You stumble back up the stairs to the hall, and take a deep refreshing breath of the clean air. Luckily, the smell doesn't seem to have stuck to your clothing.

- You plug your nose and keep going, only stopping to dry heave. It isn't long before the steps change from wood to... to something you can't comprehend. You stop and shine the light. 

#CYCLE: Fidget, mold, fungus, flesh
The rest of the stairs are covered in pink, bulbous... flesh? You shake your head. It has to be some sort of mold or fungus. You poke the next step with your foot, and the @ shivers in response. 

You shine your light to the end of the staircase, and see a door at the end of the stairs. Walls and ceiling covered in the same disgusing substance.

*[See what's behind the door]

*[Turn. Back.]

    #PLAY: flashlight_off
    Without a second thought, you rush back up the stairs to the hall. You take a deep refreshing breath of the clean air at the top, and try to make sense of what you just saw. 

    The flesh, it- it <i>reacted</i> to your touch. Your skin crawls at the thought. You don't think you should go back down there.

#STOP: footsteps_squishy, 3, 0
The tissue is soft under your shoes, making a soft, wet sound with each step. A thick ooze sticks to the bottom of your shoes.

#IMAGE: Basement
The door opens, and you are assulted by the smell. Your eyes water and you clamp your hand over your nose and mouth. You take a few steps inside, trying to see what's the cause of this god awful smell.

The room is covered in the pink, buldging flesh, thick ooze drips from the ceiling. You pan your flash light around. The room is filled with furniture covered in tarps.

*[Find the source of the smell]

*[Investigate the ooze]
    #DELAY: 1.5
    You walk deeper into the room, deeper into the maze, and approach a place where the ooze consistantly falls from the ceiling. You stick the end of the flashlight into the small pool of it. It's sticky and slippery, much more slime like than ooze.

    The flashlight flickers, and turns offs. You hit it against the palm of your hand, trying to get it to turn back on, the slime getting on you in the process.

- You walk deeper into the room. It is a maze of old furniture. Most of it is normal, chairs, tables. Some of the shapes confuse you. Some are too tall, or too wide to be anything recognizeable. 

You pass by what you assume is a standing coat hanger, and stare at it. It is taller than you, and has multiple edges jutting out from it. You reach out to lift the canvas covering it, but stop just before touching it. 

You're not sure why, but you retract your hand. You stare at the coat hanger a little longer before conitnuing on.

*[You don't check under any of the tarps.]

- You continue deeper into the room, the smell getting stronger with each step. You pray that the smell won't linger after you leave, and follow your nose to the source.

You find yourself in the far back corner, a tarp partially covering something scattered over the floor. It come us to about your chest, a stacked pile of... something. Firewood? But you don't remember seeing a fireplace upstairs...

Near the edge of the tarp you see scraps of wet cloth and... Is that... bone...? You swallow the lump in your throat.

*[Lift the tarp]

#PLAY: flashlight_off #EFFECT: flashlight
You let out a shriek and fall backwards, dropping your flashlight in the process. It turns off and rolls away.

#CYCLE: Fidget, mourn, pity, pray
Underneath the tarp lies a pile of bodies, covered in rotten flesh. Clumps of hair stuck to skulls. An amalgamation of bones fused together. You don't have time to @ for them, your only thought is to get <i>out.</i> On your hands and knees, you search the floor for your light. 

*[Search left]
~temp_bool = false
You feel to your left. The ground feels like you're touching chewed gum covered in slime. Your skin crawls with each touch of the ground, but you keep searching.

You feel a slight divot in the ground, and reach further in, hoping the flashlight rolled there. Instead, you end up shoving your hand into a pool of whatever ooze is dripping from the ceiling.

*[Search right]
~temp_bool = true
You feel to your right. The ground feels like you're touching chewed gum covered in slime. Your skin crawls with each touch of the ground, and keep searching.

Eventually, your hand bumps into something hard and metal. The flashlight. You grab it. It's covered in the same ooze that drips from the ceiling. You wipe it off with your hand, and try to turn it back on.

Blood rushes to your ears, so loud you can barely think. You need to get out of here- Out of this this slime{temp_string} You blindly try to make your way back to the door.

The ooze being to fall faster. You step in puddles. It falls on you from the ceiling. You cannot wipe it off fast enough. 

*[It's eating through you]

#ICLASS: Background Image|Swimming|Swimming-2
You wipe off another blob off your shoulder, but something goes with it. Something wet. Something warm. You stop, and reach up to touch your shoulder. Your hand shakes. Your breathing becomes short and shallow.

You start up the stairs, holding the hand rail as you go.

        ~temp_string="The longer you climb, the harder it's getting with your leg."
    - else:

}

You continue up the stairs for what feels like 5 or 6 flights, but they show no sign of stopping. Tighter and tighter they spiral, the hand rail shrinking lower and lower, and the stairs getting steeper and steeper. 

You end up climbing on all fours, treating the stairs as a ladder. {temp_string}

You stop to rest every 3 or 4 flights. If your count is right, you've stopped at least 12 times.

        ~temp_string=" Any longer, and you think you may have fallen."

}

After countless flights of stairs, you make it to the landing, crawling your way onto solid ground.{temp_string} The landing is small and square, maybe only five feet by five feet.

The only thing on the landing is a door. It's old and wooden, much like the rest of the church. It is covered in chains and locks. A metal bar is bolted across the door in a way where you could not pull or push it open, even without the chains. Soft, pulsing, red light peaks out from under it.

*[Look closer]

#PLAY: lock_rattle
You walk closer to the door, and tug at the door knob. The door jigles, but doesn't budge. Through a small keyhole, a red light pours out.
