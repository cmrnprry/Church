=== Confessional_Door
~ confessional_priest = true
You sit on the cold wooden bench. Just like the outside, the inside doesn't have many details. The grate that a priest would speak through has the same lattice work that the door does. 

You look around the cramed space and find nothing. The booth is empty. (if: $confessional_sin)[You already found a key, what more could be in the booth?](else:)[You don't know what you were expecting.]

[[Exit the booth]]

[[Look again]]
-> END
