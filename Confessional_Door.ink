    "Deep breaths." You say. "We are in no rush."

    She tries to say something else, but the coughing fit persists.

Your stomach drops. Here? <i>This</i> church? {confessional_sin: If her father is a pastor... Was he...?} Your mind races. Is it possible that...

"<i>This</i> church?" The question comes out harsher than you mean to.

"He used to, but-" She coughs. "But he hasn't in a really long-"

"Well... He used to go once a week, to pray for me, at our old church. As I got sicker, he got recommened this one, and it was okay for a while. I got a little better, but he stopped coming home..."

You ball your fists. It's not the same as what happened to you, but it's similar enough.
