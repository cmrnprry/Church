    You sit on the cold wooden bench. Just like the outside, the inside doesn't have many details. The grate that a priest would speak through has the same lattice work that the door does.

"Oh..." You hear a soft thud as she jumps off the bench. The curtain opens. "Thank-" Her voice is cut off by a massive coughing fit. "Thank- you-" she wheezes between coughs.

You need get up, and help her.

Your vision starts to blur, but you can't look away.

Why aren't you moving?

- You don't hear anything. She does not answer.

#effect: fidget #style: blur
You blink and the spell is broken.

#effect: fidget #style: blurrier
MOVE.

*[Exit the booth.]
You fall out of the booth, and check the other side. There's a splatter of blood just outside it, next to the ripped off piece of curtain. Scratch marks are etched into the wooden floor. Your flashlight shines on broken pieces of nail.

The wood splinters.

There's a small hole you can see through. You see movement from outside. {temp_string}

You step back and throw yourself at the door one last time. It gives, and you fall onto the floor. You quickly get to your feet and go to where you saw the movement.

The ripped piece of curtain lays just outside of the booth. There's a splatter of blood and scratch marks etched into the wooden floor. Your flashlight shines on broken pieces of nail.

"Oh!" She perks up immediately. "I kept miss-"

She is cut off by a coughing fit. Harsh, loud, wet coughs. 

*[Wait for her to stop]

*[Ask if she's alright]
    "Ye-" she tries to respond. "Ye-ah."

    "Deep breaths." You say. "We are in no rush."

    She tries to say something else, but the coughing fit persists.

- You wait, listening to the aggressive, wet coughs plaguing the girl on the other side. Eventually, she stops.

"Sorry," she weezes. "I'm really sick... I was hoping that my dad was... He's a priest so..."

    You shift in your seat, unsure what to say. You are _not_ a priest, and certainly not a replacement for her father...

    You are _not_ a priest, and certainly not a replacement for her father but... You want to be able to comfort her in some way.

- There's an uncomfortable silence before she speaks again.

"Since... Since I'm sick all time... sometimes I feel..." 

She's quiet for a moment. 

"I feel like a burden...." Your heart drops. "Mom is constantly praying, and Dad is always...."

She's quiet again. You don't know what to say.

No sign of the girl.

You slam your fist into the ground. Was any of that real? Is this all just a sick game to the church?

You grab the fabric and start pulling it apart. _Riiiippp_ Is anything in here real? _Riiiippp_ Can you trust your ears? Your eyes? _Riiiippp_  What can you trust in here if your own sense are compromised? _Riiiippp_ 

You stop and hold the scraps in your hand. You look at the blood splatter, then up at the confessional.

~temp_string = "You grimce"

You gather up the fabric in your hands. You swallow back the lump growing in your throat. Is this... your... fault?

It _had_ to be real. You trace a finger over the scratch marks and feel the chipped wood. What can you trust in here if your own sense are compromised?

        "Why...?" you mutter as you try to stand, your legs shakey. You turn to face the main body of the church. "What is the point to any of this...? Are you trying to...?"

        Your voice is quiet, but you know the church heard you. Deep in your gut, you know, and you waited for its response. 
        
        Any response.
    
    - temp_string == "You grimce":
        Your eyes dart back and forth between the fabric in your hands, and the intact curtain in front of you. You can't understand it.

        "What is this...?" your voice warbles, and you slowly stand. You turn to face the main body of the church. You throw out your hands, holding the fabric up like an offering. "What- what is this...?!"

        You let out a wet croak. You look around, looking for some response. 
        
        Any response.

        "What is this?" You stand and throw the scaps in your hands at the intact curtain. You turn to face the main body of the church. "What. is. THIS?!"

        You can't help but laugh. Laugh at the absurdity. At your stupidity. You remember the words on the note you were given. 
        
        _It will do anything to keep you here._

        "Is this how you get me to stay? Huh?" You look around, looking for some response. Any response. 
        
        You spit on the ground.
