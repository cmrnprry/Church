The Church at the End of the Street
*[Start Game] ->Start
*[Credits] ->Credits

=== Start ====

There is a church at the end of the street- but there shouldn't be. You saw it when walking home from the bus stop after work. You grew up on this street. You have walked down this road daily. There is not a church at the end of the street.

It was dark when you passed, and you keep telling youself that your tired brain mistook a billboard for a church. They must be building one there.

*It's impossible for a church to spring up overnight.

- You pass by again, on your walk to the bus stop this morning, and stop dead in your tracks. There should not be a church, and yet, there it sits. A "FOR SALE" sign attached to its lawn.

*You don't like it.

*You feel drawn to it.

*You want nothing to do with it

- Your stomach churns.  You shove your hand in your pocket and rub your thumb over the worn polaroid picture inside.

* You quickly cross the street.

- You mess around on your phone, trying to ignore the building. You keep looking up at it, confiriming for yourself that the church is really there. 

It was not there on the walk to the bus stop yesterday, or the day before- you're sure of it. And a new building wouldn't look so... You glance up at it again, and something pulls at the back of your mind.

The church feels...

*Familiar
~feeling = "familiar"

*Uncomfortable
~feeling = "uncomfortable"

*Evocative
~feeling = "evocative"

- It is small, with white paint peeling, revealing sun-bleached brick underneath. It's windows are intact, but everything else is cracked or crumbling. You're surprised the building is still standing.

The bus arrives and you're no closer to understanding this {feeling} church that spontaneously appeared. Your stomach lurches.

=== Investigate
You pat your pant pockets, pretending that you forgot your pass, and smile sheepishly. The driver rolls her eyes and drives off. It's still early enough where you can just catch the next one. You steel yourself and look back at the church.

*The church windows catch your eye.

-~window = true
The church's windows are of stained glass, which isn't uncommon for it to have. You squint trying to make the image out, but no matter how hard you focus, you can't explain what the glass was a picture of. 

*[You take a step forward.]

-The image swims in your vision. Just as you think you've got it, it changes. You make a mental note to get your eyes checked.

*[You take another step forward.]

Blood starts rushing in your ears and pressure builds behind your eyes as you strain to-

#PLAY: bus-sounds
You stumble backwards as the bus swerves, narrowly avoiding you. The driver opens the door and asks if you're alright. You feel youself nodding, heart pounding. A knot forms in your stomach.

*[Your eyes don't leave the church.]

- You brush off the driver's questions and board the bus.

*[Take a seat]
    You drift to the back of the bus, and sit where you can look at the church through the window.
    -> Bus.Seat
    
*"Do you know when they built that church?"

- The bus driver gives you a look.

"Is that really important right now?" he says. "Are you alright?"

*"So it was here yesterday?"

- You grip his arm as you ask. Your nails dig into his arm and he winces.

"I'm going to need you to let go." He looks [perturbed, afraid, nervous, tense]. "Do I need to call someone?"

Your eyes dart from him to the church behind him and back. You're losing it. Over a building. You need to calm down.

"I'm sorry-" You release the bus driver. "I- I-'m sorry."

*You scurry to the back of the bus.
    You find a seat where you can look at the church through the window.

You board the the bus, and scan your ticket.

*"Do you know when they built that church?"

- The bus driver looks over her shoulder, then back at you. She frowns.
"Looks older... Maybe 10, 20 years ago?"

*["So it was here yesterday?"]
"I assume as much." She closes the bus doors.

*["How long have you been working this bus route?"]
"Too long. You should know, I see you almost daily." She closes the bus doors.

- You nod and take a seat.

You watch the church through the window until it fades into a dot in the distance. Even after it's gone, you still feel on edge. A part of you wants to call out sick and go back [[home]].

#PLAY: office-sounds
You get less done than usual at work. You find yourself absently doodling and scribbling on scrap paper. Typing nonsense, only to delete it after. Staring blankly into your computer screen.

There is only one thing on your mind, one thing that shouldn't exist but it does.

That {feeling} church.

You should do somthing to take your mind off it.

*[Scan some documents]

*[Catch up on emails]

You choose to do something mindless and easy. You grab a stack of papers marketing needs sent out, and head to the machine.
~ work += 1
*Maybe the monotony will take your mind off things.

- #PLAY: scanning
You enter a rhythm of placing a page, entering an email, and sending it off. You try to focus on only your actions to prevent your mind from wandering. 

Place page. Enter email. Send it off. Place page. Enter email. Send it off. Place page. Enter email. Send it off. Place page. Enter email. Send it off. Place-

*"Hey- What are you doing?"

- #STOP: scanning, 3
You jump and look up to see a coworker from your departmenr. You don't talk to her often, but she's nice enough. She looks... concerned?

*"Just sending out some scans."

*"Busy work until the next meeting. You know how it is."

*"Trying to keep busy."

- She nods slowly, and picks up one of the papers from your done pile. "And... _this_ is what you're sending?"

"Yeah, Marketing needed-"

She cuts you off as she starts to read off what's on the page. "'Do you know about the church at the end of the street?" 

The hairs on the back of your neck stand up.

*_No_

- "The church at the end of the street knows me but I don't know it." She continues. Your chest tightens, and you frantically go through the rest of the papers. You know these were marketing reports. "It waits and waits for me to come back. It has gotten impatient."

All the papers repeat what you coworker said. Over and over again. All in handwriting. _Your_ handwriting. You clutch the papers tightly, until your knuckles go white and your nails pierce through. _When did they change?_

"Did you write this?" She purses her lips at you. "Is this your idea of a bad joke?"

*"I'm going home early today."

*"I'm going to work from home for the rest of the day."

*Say nothing and leave.

- You mark the church email as spam and respond to the client, making sure to CC the correct person they should speak to. You close your email and rub your eyes with the palm of your hands.

#DELAY: 6 #PLAY: knock-knock
"Knock knock, can I talk to you?" You look up to see your supervisor at your door, holding a few sheets of paper. They look upset.

*"Yeah, come in."
    They enter, and close the door, "I'll be quick. Can you explain what your last email meant?" They sound frustrated. "Is it a joke? A prank?"

*"Now's not a good time."
    "Right..." they say, and enter anyway. "Can you explain what your last email meant? Our client is not happy."

- 

*"What?"

*"They sent the email to the wrong department so..."

- They roll their eyes and drop the papers on your desk. "You're about to lose us our best client!" You pick them up, and your stomach drops. In your hands is are print outs of emails from you to a client. They all say the same text over and over again:

"Do you know about the church at the end of the street? The church at the end of the street knows me but I don't know it. It waits and waits for me to come back. It has gotten impatient."

"Do you understand how this can hurt sales?" They hiss. You clutch the papers until your knuckles go white, and your nails pierce through. "You'd be _lucky_ if I only suspend you for this!"

"Hey are you-" A hand grabs your shoulder, and you jump up from your chair, slaping the hand away. 

"Leave me ALONE!" you shout, breathing heavy.

"What's your problem?!" You realize all too late that this was not the church, but your coworker. You stumble over yourself trying to appologize. "We all have rought days but.... What the hell?!"

- It shows an image of the church, but in a different place. Not at the end of your street, but near your grandparents house, several states away. You see a younger version of yourself standing outside and smiling. 

Your mouth goes dry.

*[Scroll down]

- Under the image is the text "Don't keep it waiting."

You slam the laptop shut. A fuzzy memory tickles the back of your mind, and suddenly it all clicks into place.

*[You know the church.]

- You don't know how, but you know it. You slam you fist against your desk. "Why can't I...?" You mutter.

The memory refuses to surface, only vague images and feelings. You see yourself inside. You're scared. You're trapped. But that's all you can remember. You hit the desk again, harder. 

"It's right there, so just..." You murmer to yourself. "I was...?"

You found something. It let you out? No. It wouldn't-

*"Everything... Okay...? In here?"

- It's your coworker. You wave him away, and focus. You escaped. It wants you back. You can see the door opening, but the younger you didn't feel relief. No, they felt... afraid? Why...? You got out so why-

Your coworker grabs your sholder, "Hey what's-" You jump up from your chair and smack his hand away. You lean on the wall to support yourself, breathing heavy. "What's your problem?!"

Your coworker stares at you, waiting for an answer. You shove your hand into your pocket, searching for the poleroid inside, hoping to calm yourself.

"No no no, where...?" You franticly searching every pocket, only to find it all empty. You look to your desk and find small, ripped pieces of a once comforting memory. "Did I...?"

"Seriously, what's up with you?!" You gather the pieces in your hands, and begin trying to tape them together, but the pieces are too small. You swallow the lump in your throat, and face your coworker. "Uhhh... You alright?"

It's dark, but you can make out vague shapes.

{

- else: You know it's useless, but fear overtakes the rational part of your brain. There has to be SOMETHING.
}

You look everywhere, arms outstretched, blindly feeling around your surroundings. On and under what you imagine are pews, the floor, past the curtain? Into a... cupboard? Closet? As you search, you get the feeling of deja vu. You've done this before.

*[Nothing.]

- You go further into the church, up a few steps, feeling the walls as you do, and find a closed door at the end of the hall. It might have what you're looking for.

*You hope for a crowbar.

}

You open the door to find a side office, entirely covered in dust and cobwebs. The adjacent walls were book shelfs full of books. The far wall has a desk with a stained glass window above it. You avoid looking at the window.

On the desk sits a {object}, illuminated by a red spotlight from the window. It's not covered in dust like rest of the room, as if it has been placed there just for you.

You jam the crowbar in between the door and the wall, at the latch, and pull. 

*The door groans.

You pull harder, putting all your weight into it. You lean back a bit further and-

You check the top.

*All the screws are intact.

- "No, no, no, nonononono." You mutter and check the bottom as well.

You drop to the floor, and feel you the screws you heard fall.

You can't find them.

= Remember
You pull the polaroid out from your pocket, hoping to think about better times. It's dark, but you can see enough to make out shapes. You trace the image of your younger self, and the gate behind them with your finger, then the church behind-

Church? 

*[Your mouth goes dry.]

- The image is different. It has changed. Insead of a comforting memory, it has morphed into one you don't know. Something that tickles the back of your brain, but you don't know why.

*[You grip the picture tightly in your hands.]

- The image isn't fake, somehow you know this. The church always felt {feeling} in a way you didn't understand why.

The memory refuses to surface, only vague images and feelings. If you close your eyes... You're scared. You're trapped. You're... inside? Inside where-?

Your nails peirce through the image, and your knuckles turn white. Your hands shake as you try to remember when- 

<i>Riiiiipppppp</i>
~ photo_ripped = true
The image rips in half.

And it all clicks into place. 

*You have been here before.

- <i>Riiiiipppppp</i>

You don't know how you could have forgotten. How you didn't realize it before. 

<i>Riiiiipppppp</i>

You have been here before. You found... something- No. Someone? You can't remember, but <i>you got out.</i>

<i>Riiiiipppppp</i>

There is a way out.

<i>Riiiiipppppp</i>

*You just need to figure out how.

- You blink rapidly, shaking yourself out of the memory, and look down at what's left of the image in your hand. Tiny pieces sit in a pile on the ground in front of you. Did you...?

You swallow the lump in your throat and carefully pick up pieces, ensuring you get every little piece. You delicately place them back in your pocket. Once you're out of here, you can fix it.

It was a simple thought. The only things you know are that you found something when you were young, and you escaped. 

A fleeting memory won't help you now. 

*What if you accept it?

- A low hum echos through the room, and a chill runs through you at the sudden sound. That's what the church wants but...

*What's wrong with that?

*You can't let the church win
-> Trapped.Refuse

- Why are you even trying to fight back? What has the church actually done to harm you? What are you trying to get back to?

A light melody begins to play. A lullaby, you think. It was a comfort when you were young and alone. 

You hum along to it.

No. You rub your eyes. No. You can't stay. The church didn't just <i>let</i> you out last time. It did so for this moment. For after you let your guard down.

You try to focus harder. You can just barely make it out.

"You... came back. Why... Why did you come back...?" over and over again.

- You slowly stand and look around for the source, taking a few steps into the church. You open your mouth, but before any words can leave your lips, cold, unseen hands covers your mouth. You freeze.

"Don't," is whispered into your ear, a woman's voice.

*[Nod]

*[Try to remove the hands]
You claw at your mouth, attempting to grab hands silencing you, and stand up. "Let GO!" 

"You don't... remember..." The hands fall away, and the room goes still. "This is all I can do."

The hands fall away. The voice goies quiet. A red light glows from above you.
-> Trapped.Light

- "Look up." The hands removes themselves from your mouth, and rest on your shoulder. You look where the voice told you to. The window above the door has morphed into a stained glass eye. It's pupil darts around, looking for something. "It looks for you."

You look back down, and the hands disappear behind you. You can feel something cold hovering near you.

You have so many questions.

*"What IS that?"

*"Who, or what, are you?"

*"How do I get out?"

- The voice does not answer, but you know it's still there. You can feel it hovering by your ear.

"This is all I can do for you now. The rest is up to you."

Wind blows around you, and before you stop yourself you call out.

*"Wait!"
