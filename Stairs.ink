You walk deeper down the hallway to the stairs. Going up, is a spiral staircase. Going down, is a long set of stairs. You can't see the end of either.

You continue up for what feels like 5 or 6 flights, but they show ni sign of stopping. Tighter and tighter they spiral, the hand rail gets lower and lower, and the stairs get steeper and steeper. You end up climbing on all fours, almost treating the stairs as a ladder, they're so steep. {temp_string}

You stop to rest every 3 or 4 flights. If your count is right, you've stopped at least 12 times.

}

After countless flights of stairs, you make it to the landing, crawling your way onto solid ground.{temp_string} The landing is small and square, maybe only five feet by five feet.

The only thing on the landing is a door. It's old and wooden, much like the rest of the church. It is covered in chains and locks. A metal bar is bolted across the door in a way where you could not pull or push it open, even without the chains. Soft, pulsing, red light peaks out from under it.

You take a closer look at the locks. There are three main ones, all are slightly different. 

The top lock looks almost like something you'd find in an antique shop, made of heavy iron. It has a small key hole, and looks to be holding the chains together. The chains themselves aren't very think, but are sturdy. {temp_string}

The middle lock seems to be slightly newer. It doesn't require a key, but a four digit number code. It is attched to the metal bar that keeps the knob from turning. Removing this lock would probably allow the door to be opened.

The last lock is a sliding chain door that appartments usually have inside to prevent people from forcing their way in. Sliding it all the way to the end makes a smaller deadbolt slide into place, keeping the door unopenable. There is no obvious keyhole.

- You try a few combinations on the number lock, thinking you can guess code. Trying to enter today's date, the year, your birthday- Anything meaningful set of four numbers you can think of. After a few minutes, you give up.

You pull at the chain lock, but it's tightly fastened to the door. You grab at the chain itself and pull, thinking the thinner chain might snap under the pressure, but it holds fast. You then try messing with the sliding lock as well, trying to see if there's a trick to it. If there is, you can't figure it out.

-The door opens, and you are assulted by the smell. Your eyes water and you clamp your hand over your nose and mouth. You take a few steps inside, trying to see what's the cause of this god awful smell.

The room is covered in the pink, buldging flesh, thick ooze drips from the ceiling. You pan your flash light around. The room is filled with furniture covered in tarps.

*[Your hand starts to itch]

- You walk deeper into the room. It is a maze of old furniture. Most of it is normal, chairs, tables. Some of the shapes confuse you. Some are too tall, or too wide to be anything recognizeable. 

You pass by what you assume is a standing coat hanger, and stare at it. It is taller than you, and has multiple edges jutting out from it. You reach out to lift the canvas covering it, but stop just before touching it. 

You're not sure why, but you retract your hand. You stare at the coat hanger a little longer before conitnuing on.

*[You don't check under any of the tarps.]

- You continue deeper into the room, the smell getting stronger with each step. You pray that the smell won't linger after you leave, and follow your nose to the source.

You find yourself in the far back corner, a tarp partially covering something scattered over the floor. It come us to about your chest, a stacked pile of... something. Firewood? But you don't remember seeing a fireplace upstairs...

Near the edge of the tarp you see scraps of wet cloth and... Is that... bone...? You swallow the lump in your throat.

You let out a shriek and fall backwards, dropping your flashlight in the process. It turns off and rolls away.

Underneath the tarp lies a pile of bodies, covered in rotten flesh. Clumps of hair stuck to skulls. An amalgamation of bones fused together. You don't have time to <mourn, pity, pray> for them, your only thought is to get _out._ On your hands and knees, you search the floor for your light.
