You approach the bookshelves. In addition to all the books, water-stained boxes and a decaying wooden chest littered the shelves. You pick through the boxes first, only to find them filled with more books. You grab the chest and try opening it, only to find it to be locked. You give it a shake, and hear something shaking around inside.
        
        "Probably another book..." you mutter. You look through the key hole, but can't see anything.

- You put the chest back on the shelf, and grab a random book. It has no title, but the number 2743 is on the cover in thick, gold-colored lettering.

The first page has the name "Mary" in script. A dedication, maybe? You flip to the next page and begin to read. The color almost immediately drains from your face. You jump to the end, and your stomach tightens. You throw the book to the floor, and grab another off it's shelf. 1924, Jeff. 2952, Adrian. 1853, Reed.

Tentatively, you pick up Mary's book again, and begin to read.

The start is jarrying. Mary is stuck in a storm, and stumbled upon the church while looking for a place to rest. Her version of the churchUnlike your expereince, this was her first time meeting the church. Her first thought upon seeing it was: _Finally, salvation._ 

She did not hesitate to take shelter inside. 

Once inside, Mary wanders to the pews. Then a very familiar scene begins to play out: a beautiful melody begins to play and the church warms itself. You can't be sure is the melody is the same you heard, but it brought tears to Mary's eyes. 

The last page details how the beautiful melody lulled her into a sense security. How her final breaths were peacful. How her body melted into wood after she was gone.

You close the book, and place it back on the shelf. Your insides twist and lurch as you look over all the books that litter the floor, and sit on the shelves. All these books- no. All these _people_ are victims who never got out.

Your skin starts to tingle, which quickly turns into a searing pain. You scream and drop your book, clawing at the pain, trying to make it stop. You stare down at your hands to see angry red lines etched in your skin. You roll up your shirt and see the same thing.

Your skin bubbles and and oozes as these line change their shape to form words. Words you have read over and over again. _You found peace. You found peace. You found peace. You found peace._

"No, stop. Stop!" 

Your words fall on deaf ears as you can only watch the words from your book engrave themselves in your skin. You drop to the floor, and curl into the fetal position. Tears leak from your eyes, a soothing comfort as they roll over your bleeding skin. 

You wimper as the branding finishes, every part of your skin prickles. You bring your trembling hands to your face, and they are stained with your blood. Slowly, slowly, you sit up. Your clothing peels over the wooden floor. The branding already looks healed over, but the pain is still fresh.

You end up in the pews, just like your book said you would. You sit down, and close your eyes, taking in the church music. When you open them, the pews are filled with people, all turned towards you. It's people you've read about, smiling at you. Welcoming you.

They begin to sing, hands out streached for you to take. The music flows through you, and you feel a smile come to your face.

You take a closer look at the locks. There are three main ones, all are slightly different. 

The top lock looks almost like something you'd find in an antique shop, made of heavy iron. It has a small key hole, and looks to be holding the chains together. The chains themselves aren't very think, but are sturdy. {temp_string}

The middle lock seems to be slightly newer. It doesn't require a key, but a four digit number code. It is attched to the metal bar that keeps the knob from turning. Removing this lock would probably allow the door to be opened.

The last lock is a sliding chain door that appartments usually have inside to prevent people from forcing their way in. Sliding it all the way to the end makes a smaller deadbolt slide into place, keeping the door unopenable. There is no obvious keyhole.

You pull at the chain lock, but it's tightly fastened to the door. You grab at the chain itself and pull, thinking the thinner chain might snap under the pressure, but it holds fast. You then try messing with the sliding lock as well, trying to see if there's a trick to it. If there is, you can't figure it out.

#play: 1, squish-squash
_You've made it this far, might as well see it it toward the end,_ you think, and take a deep breath through your mouth. Slowly, you make it to the bottom of the stairs.

_Squish_

#stop: 3, squish-squash
The tissue is soft under your shoes, making a soft, wet sound with each step. A thick ooze sticks to the bottom of your shoes.

_Squelch_

*[Open the door]

-The door opens, and you are assulted by the smell. Your eyes water and you clamp your hand over your nose and mouth. You take a few steps inside, trying to see what's the cause of this god awful smell.

The room is covered in the pink, buldging flesh, thick ooze drips from the ceiling. You pan your flash light around. The room is filled with furniture covered in tarps.

*[Find the source of the smell]

*[Investigate the ooze]
#delay: 1.5
You walk deeper into the room, deeper into the maze, and approach a place where the ooze consistantly falls from the ceiling. You stick the end of the flashlight into the small pool of it. It's sticky and slippery, much more slime like than ooze.

#play: click-on #play: 1, click-off #play: 1, click-on #play: 1, click-off
The flashlight flickers, and turns offs. You hit it against the palm of your hand, trying to get it to turn back on, the slime getting on you in the process.
->Stairs.Melt

*[Your hand starts to itch]

- You walk deeper into the room. It is a maze of old furniture. Most of it is normal, chairs, tables. Some of the shapes confuse you. Some are too tall, or too wide to be anything recognizeable. 

You pass by what you assume is a standing coat hanger, and stare at it. It is taller than you, and has multiple edges jutting out from it. You reach out to lift the canvas covering it, but stop just before touching it. 

You're not sure why, but you retract your hand. You stare at the coat hanger a little longer before conitnuing on.

*[You don't check under any of the tarps.]

- You continue deeper into the room, the smell getting stronger with each step. You pray that the smell won't linger after you leave, and follow your nose to the source.

You find yourself in the far back corner, a tarp partially covering something scattered over the floor. It come us to about your chest, a stacked pile of... something. Firewood? But you don't remember seeing a fireplace upstairs...

Near the edge of the tarp you see scraps of wet cloth and... Is that... bone...? You swallow the lump in your throat.

*[Lift the tarp]

- #play: click-off
You let out a shriek and fall backwards, dropping your flashlight in the process. It turns off and rolls away.

#style: fidget, <mourn, pity, pray>
Underneath the tarp lies a pile of bodies, covered in rotten flesh. Clumps of hair stuck to skulls. An amalgamation of bones fused together. You don't have time to <mourn, pity, pray> for them, your only thought is to get _out._ On your hands and knees, you search the floor for your light. 

*[Search left]
~temp_bool = false
You feel to your left. The ground feels like you're touching chewed gum covered in slime. Your skin crawls with each touch of the ground, but you keep searching.

You feel a slight divot in the ground, and reach further in, hoping the flashlight rolled there. Instead, you end up shoving your hand into a pool of whatever ooze is dripping from the ceiling.

*[Search right]
~temp_bool = true
You feel to your right. The ground feels like you're touching chewed gum covered in slime. Your skin crawls with each touch of the ground, and keep searching.

Eventually, your hand bumps into something hard and metal. The flashlight. You grab it. It's covered in the same ooze that drips from the ceiling. You wipe it off with your hand, and try to turn it back on.

You wipe off any remaining ooze on your shirt, but that only causes the itching to spread. 

*[It burns]

{
    - temp_bool:
        ~temp_string = ". You have the flashlight."
    - else:
        ~temp_string = ", flashlight be damned."
}

Blood rushes to your ears, so loud you can barely think. You need to get out of here- Out of this this slime{temp_string} You blindly try to make your way back to the door.

The ooze being to fall faster. You step in puddles. It falls on you from the ceiling. You cannot wipe it off fast enough. 

*[It's eating through you]

- You wipe off another blob off your shoulder, but something goes with it. Something wet. Something warm. You stop, and reach up to touch your shoulder. Your hand shakes. Your breathing becomes short and shallow.

*[You feel bone.]

- You can't breathe.$[Your skin burns.] You can't think. Bone? How-? $[Your skin burns.] Your head swims. $[Your skin burns.]You can't get enough air in. $[Your skin burns.] Is this slime-?

*[Your skin burns.]

- You keep going, desperatly trying to escape. $[You can't feel your hand anymore.] You trip over yourself, and fall into puddle of the acidic ooze. $[You can't feel your legs.]

*[You can't feel anything.]

{temp_string} you decide to head back down, assuming you can find a way to unlock them down in the church's main body.

When you turn to go back down, dreading the climb, the staircase has changed into one normal flight of stairs. You can see the bottom of the landing. 

Tentatively, you go down the stairs, ready for it to warp or change at any moment. When you reach the bottom and look back, the stairs are once again a spiral stair case. Shining your flashlight back up, you only see darkness. 

If you weren't sure before, you are now: Behind that door lies the heart.
