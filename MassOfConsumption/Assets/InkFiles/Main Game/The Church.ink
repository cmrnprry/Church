=== StartGame ====
There is a church at the end of the street- but there shouldn't be. You saw it when walking home from the bus stop after work. You grew up on this street. You have walked down this road daily. There is not a church at the end of the street.

It was dark when you passed, and you keep telling yourself that your tired brain mistook a constuction site billboard for a church. They must be building one there.

*[It's impossible for a church to spring up overnight.]

#IMAGE: Bus Stop
You pass by again, on your walk to the bus stop this morning, and stop dead in your tracks. There should not be a church, and yet, there it sits. It's small, with white paint peeling, revealing sun-bleached brick underneath. It's windows are intact, but everything else is cracked or crumbling. A faded "FOR SALE" sign attached to its lawn.

#CYCLE: decrepit, worn-down, enigmatic, old
It was not there on the walk to the bus stop yesterday, or the day before- you're sure of it. And a new building wouldn't look so @. You swallow hard.

*[You don't care for it]
    ~church_interest = "care"
    
    The feeling isn't strong, you just know you don't particularly like that there's a church there. Similar to when your grandma would put raisins in her cookies, something you don't mind but wish weren't there. 
    
    #CYCLE: uncomfortable, interesting, awkward, rough
    You've always had a... @ relationship with religion, and you haven't step foot in a church since your grandparents dragged you along as a kid. You've seen other churches, but none have made you feel so...
    
*[You feel drawn to it]
    ~church_interest = "drawn"
    #CYCLE: uncomfortable, interesting, awkward, rough
    It's a slight tugging in your gut that pulls you to it. You've always had a... @ relationship with religion, so this attraction puzzles, and to an extent, disturbs, you. 
    
    You haven't step foot in a church since your grandparents dragged you along as a kid. You've seen other churches, but none have made you feel so...

*[You're nauseous just looking at it]
    ~church_interest = "nothing"
    #CYCLE: uncomfortable, interesting, awkward, rough
    You've never been so repulsed by a building before. You've always had a... @ relationship with religion, but this? This church? It makes you want to get in a car and keep driving until the tank runs dry. 
    
    You haven't step foot in a church since your grandparents dragged you along as a kid. You've seen other churches, but none have made you feel so...

You pat your pant pockets, pretending that you forgot your pass, and smile sheepishly. The driver rolls her eyes. "I won't tell. Just don't make it a habit." She winks at you.

At the office, you get less work done than usual. You find yourself absently doodling and scribbling on scrap paper. Typing nonsense, only to delete it after. Staring blankly into your computer screen.

# INTRUSIVE: 1, Is it still there?, Job.Stop_Thinking
There is only one thing on your mind, one thing that shouldn't exist but it does. That {church_feeling} church.

You find yourself in your boss' office, staring at the floor as her eyes bore into you. She says nothing for a long time, the only sound is the ticking clock and the tapping of her nails against the desk. You chew on the inside of your cheek and pick at your nails as you wait for her to say something— anything. After an eternity, she lets out a long and deep, disappointed sigh.

"Care to explain yourself?" You snap up, and she stares at you, waiting. "You know how I feel about tardiness. And on today of all days too!"

#PROP: polaroid # REMOVE: INTRUSIVE
You pull the polaroid out from your pocket, hoping to think about better times. It's dark, but you can see enough to make out shapes. You trace the image of your younger self, and the gate behind them with your finger, then the church behind—

Church? 

*[Your mouth goes dry.]

- The image is different. It has changed. Instead of a comforting memory, it has morphed into one you don't know. Something that tickles the back of your brain, but you don't know why.

*[You grip the picture tightly in your hands.]

- The image isn't fake, somehow you know this. The church always felt {church_feeling} in a way you didn't understand why.

#PROP: polaroid
The memory refuses to surface, only vague images and feelings. If you close your eyes... You're scared. You're trapped. You're... inside? Inside where—?

Your nails peirce through the image, and your knuckles turn white. Your hands shake as you try to remember when—

You swallow the lump in your throat and carefully pick up pieces, ensuring you get every little piece. You delicately place them back in your pocket. Once you're out of here, you can fix it.
