=== StartGame ====
There is a church at the end of the street- but there shouldn't be. You saw it when walking home from the bus stop after work. You grew up on this street. You have walked down this road daily. There is not a church at the end of the street.

It was dark when you passed, and you keep telling yourself that your tired brain mistook a construction site billboard for a church. They must be building one there.

*[It's impossible for a church to spring up overnight.]

#IMAGE: Bus Stop
You pass by again, on your walk to the bus stop this morning, and stop dead in your tracks. There should not be a church, and yet, there it sits. It's small, with white paint peeling, revealing sun-bleached brick underneath. It's windows are intact, but everything else is cracked or crumbling. A faded "FOR SALE" sign attached to its lawn.

#CYCLE: decrepit, worn-down, enigmatic, old
It was not there on the walk to the bus stop yesterday, or the day before- you're sure of it. And a new building wouldn't look so @. You swallow hard.

*[You don't care for it]
    ~ Church_Interest = "care"
    
    The feeling isn't strong, you just know you don't particularly like that there's a church there. Similar to when your grandma would put raisins in her cookies, something you don't mind but wish weren't there. 
    
    #CYCLE: uncomfortable, interesting, awkward, rough
    You've always had a... @ relationship with religion, and you haven't step foot in a church since your grandparents dragged you along as a kid. You've seen other churches, but none have made you feel so...
    
*[You feel drawn to it]
    ~ Church_Interest = "drawn"
    #CYCLE: uncomfortable, interesting, awkward, rough
    It's a slight tugging in your gut that pulls you to it. You've always had a... @ relationship with religion, so this attraction puzzles, and to an extent, disturbs, you. 
    
    You haven't step foot in a church since your grandparents dragged you along as a kid. You've seen other churches, but none have made you feel so...

*[You're nauseous just looking at it]
    ~ Church_Interest = "nothing"
    #CYCLE: uncomfortable, interesting, awkward, rough
    You've never been so repulsed by a building before. You've always had a... @ relationship with religion, but this? This church? It makes you want to get in a car and keep driving until the tank runs dry. 
    
    You haven't step foot in a church since your grandparents dragged you along as a kid. You've seen other churches, but none have made you feel so...

You pat your pant pockets, pretending that you forgot your pass, and smile sheepishly. The driver rolls her eyes. "I won't tell if you won't. Just don't make it a habit." She winks at you.

You shift your weight, and check your watch. Your boss has been watching you like a hawk recently, so maybe this is some divine intervention telling you to not press your luck.

She blinks at you, then shrugs, "Whatever you say." She says, exhasperated, and closes the doors. You wince at her tone and hope you didn't ruin the relationship as you watch her pull away. 

Once the bus is out of view, you let out the breath you were holding and steel yourself. You need to be quick about this to avoid a 10 minute scolding later. You look back to the church.

    Your voice comes out high and tight. You watch her silhouette bounce in excitement. "George! George! Come here! Our favourite grandchild called!" She waves behind her and another silhouette hobbles next to her. "To what do we owe the pleasure?"

        A flurry of emotions whirl within you, many of which you fail to identify. You know you need to escape this light, but you want to stay longer. You'll leave in just a second.

        ~temp_string = "worry is a flag that something is very <i>wrong.</i>"
        Something is wrong. Logically, you know you should feel something negative. Fear. Panic. Alarm. But the most you can muster up is worry. Worry that you will never be bathed in this light again.

    An earsplitting shriek pierces through the building. You cover your ears, but it only gets louder and louder the more you block it out. The pressure builds until you can barely stand, the warm bath of the light burns your skin.

    A satisfied groan reverberates through the building. Slowly, the eye closes, and the red light with it. 

    "N—no!" you scramble forward, chasing the last licks of the light before its gone. The pressure alleviates, and all the { Light_Feeling  == confused: confused emotions go | {Light_Feeling} goes } with it. The window returns to it's normal, swirling state. 

    With the light gone, you snap back to reality. "Why did I...?" you mutter to yourself. You dig your nails into your hand.

On the ground in front of you sits a flashlight and a note.

It looks battery operated, and gives off enough light to see around you. You should be able to explore with this.

- The note is from an old piece of parchment. It feels like it could crumple into dust.

    #PROP: note
    You shutter at the thought. You wonder how long you have until it fully digests you.

*[Sight...?]
    #PROP: note
    Well.... You glance up at the swirling window.
    
    You remember how the church's sight warped your thoughts and reasoning. {Church_Encounters ? (Leave_Light): How you had to pull yourself out. | How you would have done anything to stay there a little longer.} You cannot let that happen again. If the church sees you again...

*[Heart...?]
    #PROP: note
    <i>Find and destroy the heart.</i> You think about what the "heart" of the church would be. A sacred artifact or maybe something more literal? You hope you'll know it when you see it.

#IMAGE: Church_Inside #CHECKPOINT: 3, You are told to find the heart.
The flashlight gives off enough light for you to see what's near you. You can make out a podium facing some pews, a confessional off to the side, and a some stairs leading up into a longer hallway{Looked_For_Items:, which you know has a small office to the right}.

    - Crawl: You {Leg_State >= Limping: limp up | climb} the short set of stairs, and let out an exasperated laugh. The door to the office is no longer a door, but a small opening through the wall.
