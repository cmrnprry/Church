You walk around and plot onto the old desk chair. It groans in protest under your weight. You pull open the desk drawers and dig through their contents. Most only contain broken or otherwise unusable writing utencils or paper scraps to old to make any text out, but one drawer holds a small key.

The key is {items_obtained ? (Heart_Key): about the same size as the one you got before, but much less interesting. It is grey and nondescript, and i| small, grey and nondescript. I}t looks similar to a generic house key. You slip it into your pocket.

You grab the chest, and nearly drop it. The sides are slick with a wet, velvety mold. You wipe your hands on your pants and clench and unclench them, trying to forget the feeling. 

"Gross gross gross gross gross," You say and gingerly pick it up, avoiding as many mold spots as you can. You attempt to open it, only to find it locked. You give it a shake, and hear something thumping around inside.

*[Look at the books]

- You put the chest back on the shelf, and grab a random book. It has no title, but the number 2743 is on the cover in thick, gold-colored lettering.

The first page has the name "Mary" in script. A dedication, maybe? You flip to the next page and begin to read. The color almost immediately drains from your face. You jump to the end, and your stomach tightens. You throw the book to the floor, and grab another off it's shelf. 1924, Jeff. 2952, Adrian. 1853, Reed. 

All the stories are the same: They entered the church, and never left.

The start is jarrying. Mary is stuck in a storm, and stumbled upon the church while looking for a place to rest. Her version of the churchUnlike your expereince, this was her first time meeting the church. Her first thought upon seeing it was: <i>Finally, salvation.</i> 

She did not hesitate to take shelter inside. 

Once inside, Mary wanders to the pews. Then a very familiar scene begins to play out: a beautiful melody begins to play and the church warms itself. You can't be sure is the melody is the same you heard, but it brought tears to Mary's eyes. 

The last page details how the beautiful melody lulled her into a sense security. How her final breaths were peacful. How her body melted into wood after she was gone.

You close the book, and place it back on the shelf. Your insides twist and lurch as you look over all the books that litter the floor, and sit on the shelves. All these books- no. All these <i>people</i> are victims who never got out.

You pass by what you assume is a standing coat hanger, and stare at it. It is taller than you, and has multiple edges jutting out from it. You reach out to lift the canvas covering it, but stop just before touching it.

    **[Turn around and try again]
        "Third time's the charm," You mutter, turning back down the stairs, methodically checking for the landing after each step. 
        
        A flight or two later, you barely make out a flat platfrom at the edge of your flashlight's range. You don't think and rush down the rest of the stairs, running face first into a door. The scent of rotting flesh hits you a second later.
        
        #CYCLE: mold, fungus, flesh
        You gasp, taking a step back and slipping on something leaking from the door, landing on a squishy mass. It shivers in response to your touch. You yelp, jumping away{went_downstairs >=3:, eyes fixed on the quivering @. |, and see the walls and stairs covered in the same bulbous @.}
        
        In frustration you kick the door{leg == "worst":, then supress a curse as a sharp pain shoots up your leg}. Is this your only option? A rotting basment? You wonder if you can return now that you've made it to the end? Or if you'll end up somewhere worse.

            You don't think anything could be worse than the smell eminating from the door in front of you and decide to try climbing the stairs one last time. The @ sticks to your shoes as you step on it, like warm gum. Your lip curls and you hope you can scrape it off later.
            
            #DELAY: 4
            The stentch fades and the substance coating the walls dissipates as you reach the top. You pull yourself out of the stairwell, finding yourself at the landing you were desperately searching for. You could almost kiss the ground.

                You collapse to the floor, resting after all the back and forth on the stairs. You close your eyes and lean against the wall. Your body welcomes the much needed break, as you feel some tension release.
                
                TODO: this reads weird!
                "There's no time for this!" A woman's voice, a soft anger, rips through the quiet and freezing hands shove you over the edge of the stairs.
                
                #DELAY: 2
                Your eyes snap open as you pull yourself into a ball, covering your head with your arms. Your whole body tenses as you brace for impact—

You start up the stairs, holding the hand rail as you go. You take a break after about 5 or 6 flights, hoping that you're close to the top, but the top doesn't look any closer. With a huff, you continue up.

Tighter and tighter the stairs spiral. The hand rail sinking lower and lower. The incline becoming steeper and steeper. After a count of 14 flights, you wonder if this is a fruitless effort. Sweat runs down your back, and your legs throb from effort. {leg != "": The leg you tried to kick the door in feels particularly weak.}

*[Give up]
    Shaking your head, you make the journey back down the stairs. Thankfully, going down was much easier than going up. As the hand rail once again rises to sit at a reasonable height and the spiral gradually straightens out, you believe you made the correct choice.
        -> Stairs.Downstairs_Trick

*[Power through]
    
- You power through, only stopping to rest when your limbs refuse to cooperate. 

At some point, you end up almost fully vertical, treating the stairs as a ladder. Your finger tips burn from gripping the ground so tightly{leg == "worst":, your injured leg screaming from the exertion}. Resting became a risk, fearing that losing any momentum, even for a moment, would cause you to fall back and tumble back to the start.

        The only thing on the landing is a door. It's old and wooden, much like the rest of the church. It is covered in chains and locks. A metal bar is bolted across the door in a way where you could not pull or push it open, even without the chains. Soft, pulsing, red light peaks out from under it.
    - else:
        And you skid across a wooden floor and crash into a door. You blink rapidly and slowly uncurl yourself, trying to understand where you are and what just happened. That voice sounded similar to the one that gave you your flashlight, but she had a cold anger to her voice. You don't know what you did to attrack her ire, but she must have brought you here for a reason.
        
        You find youself on a small landing, maybe only five feet by five feet. It sharply drops off on the edges. You crawl forwaard to the edge and look down. You find yourself staring down the spiral staircase, it's coils wound much tighter and steeper than you thought possible. You back up from the edge.

- The top lock looks almost like something you'd find in an antique shop, made of heavy iron. It has a small key hole, and looks to be holding the chains together. The chains themselves aren't very think, but are sturdy. {broke_key: You mentally kick yourself for snapping the key earlier. There's a chance it matched this lock. | {items_obtained ? (Heart_Key) or items_obtained ? (Combo): Maybe you could...}}

The middle lock seems to be slightly newer. It doesn't require a key, but a four digit number code. It is attched to the metal bar that keeps the knob from turning. Removing this lock would probably allow the door to be opened.
TODO: add bit here about seeing 4 numbers around

The last lock is a sliding chain door that appartments usually have inside to prevent people from forcing their way in. Sliding it all the way to the end makes a smaller deadbolt slide into place, keeping the door unopenable. There is no obvious keyhole.

- You try a few combinations on the number lock, thinking you can guess code. Trying to enter today's date, the year, your birthday— Anything meaningful set of four numbers you can think of. After a few minutes, you give up.

You tug at the chain lock, but it's tightly fastened to the door. You grab at the chain itself and pull, thinking the thinner chain might snap under the pressure, but it holds fast. You then try messing with the sliding lock as well, trying to see if there's a trick to it. If there is, you can't figure it out.
