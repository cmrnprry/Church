#CHECKPOINT: 3, The pews are... full?
You exit the confessional, and stop in your tracks. The pews are full of people, and a church organ is playing. The people, if you could even call them that, have no faces or distiguishing marks. They're more of just... the general shape of people, flickering in and out of view. They don't seem to notice you.

The stairwell at the other end of the room glows from a light, red light. Your eyes scan the windows, but the eyes are closed.

Quickly, and quietly you a seat in the front row, and the light dims. A pastor climbs the stage and looks around, nodding at the figures. It looks at you, and tilts it's head. While it has no face, you can feel it smiling. It raises a hand, and points at you. You try to hide in your seat, and look away.

A red spotlight land on you. You freeze. It's the light from the window behind the priest, and gives off the same {temp_string} feeling as before. {Church_Encounters ? (Leave_Light): "It warms your body, and some of the tension melts away." | "Your skin tingles under it's warmth. It's uncomfortable. " } 

"Ah, there... you... are..." The pastor says, each word drawn out and emphasized. It's voice is raspy and harsh, like it's not used to speaking human language. 

The pastor on stage is beckoning you to join him. All eyes are on you. {Church_Encounters ? (Leave_Light): You fidget with your clothing, not sure what to do with your hands.

There's no way to get to the stairs without the "people" noticing you. You take a breath before darting across the stage and to the stairs. At the top of the stairs is {Looked_For_Items: the office door from earlier. | a closed door.} The hallway extends to a larger set of stairs going up and down.

You hear someone call your name, but you don't dare turn around. You don't know if you're being followed or not. You choose the... 

*[{Looked_For_Items: Office | Door}]

*[Stairs]
    ~ Met_Mimic = true
    You take off down the hallway.  The stairs going up, is a spiral staircase, while going down, is a long set of stairs. You grab the railing and pull yourself down the stairs. You stop when you can just barely see the top and crouch, listening for any sign that you're being followed.
    
    You hear your name again and tense, taking a few more steps down the stairs. A large shadow obscures the opening of the stairs. They call for you again, staying above the stairs, "Come out. It's just me." Their voice echos down the stairwell and you shiver. It's voice matches the one from the woman who let you the flashlight.
    
    **[Come out]
        The voice, the intonation, it matches to perfectly to simply be a good mimic. You begin to stand when freezing cold hands press down on your shoulders. "It's not me," she breaths into your ear, voice barely audible. "It's-" 
        {
            - Stay_Tracker > 3:
            You don't care, you know what you heard. Who's to say <i>this</i> voice is the fake? You shrug it off and climb the stairs. "I'm here!"
            
            #CYCLE: walks, slithers, clops, flies, swims
            "I'm here." The person turns to face you. You turn on your flashlight at you reach the top, shining it on the <s>person</s> being in front of you, and stop. It is much taller than you, and covered in what looks like a patchword quilt. Every part being swallowed up by fabric. It @ closer toward you.
            
            #CYCLE: hand, claw, tentacle, paw, fin
            It smiles says "Found... You..." The words reverberate inside your brain. It holds out a @ for you to take.
            
            
            ***[Take it]
                #CYCLE: hand, claw, tentacle, paw, fin
                "Don't!" She screams, but again you wave her off and take its @. It laughs, or at least, that's what you think the sound is. It stops and pulls you closer, lowering it's hood. You scream and pull away, but its grip on you is like steel.
                
                TODO gluping sound
                Its face is an empy hole of mouths. Tendrils rise out of the hole and shoot toward your face. They enter your nose, ears, eyes, mouth, anywhere they can, and they begin to drink.
                
                TODO gross popping sound
                You shriek and squirm and hit, but nothing matters. It takes more than blood, but less than flesh. A tendril wraps around your eye and squeezes until it pops, slurping up the jelly pieces left behind. You can feel them ripping your insides apart and pulverizing them into a think soup. Any part it doesn't want are uncerimoniously ripped out and discarded.

            You nod, and crouch lower, her voice snapping you out of it. If you listen closer, you can hear ragged breathing coming from the mimic and a scrating against the wood as it moves. 
            
            You feel her nearby as you wait out the creature. Eventually, it howls and rams itself into the wall. Over and over, a wet slamming sound. With a final scream, you hear receding footsteps. You hold the position for a moment longer before deciding it was safe enough. You stand.
            
            "Thank you." You say, but she's already gone. You blow air out of your nose and glace between the pool of darkness down the stairs and back up to where the mimic was.

        You hold your breath, listening for movement. You hear a shuffling, and see a shadow move in front of the curtain. A hand with long, thin fingers reaches into the booth and slide from side to side.
        
        A scream bubbles in your throat, but you swallow it. It stops, and retreats. You hear it say something you can't understand. A cross between human language and the growl of a creature.

        You find the knob and turn it, falling back into the confessional. You kick the door closed and scramble toward it, using your body to hold the creature back. It never pushes back.

You drop down from the stage, and walk through the pews. Everyone is gone.

{Church_Encounters ? (Finger_Chopped): You stop when you reach the end of the rows. You look back at the stage, then up at the window. It's eye is closed. You sit on the floor, crossed—legged, and just stare at the window. {finger_pain_pass: Your hand twitches. You can't say it hurts anymore. Instead, it feels...<br><br> Soothing. | Your hand aches, and you lightly brush the wound.<br><br>It hurts.}} {Church_Encounters ? (Was_Coward): You stop at the pew {Book_Knowledge ? (Read_Mom_Old_Book):Ophelia | the woman} had sat at. You put your hand— your intact hand— on the wooden pew before taking a seat yourself.}

You bow your head and squeeze the wire cutters in your hand.

{Have_Visited ? (Stairs_Up): There' are not many places left to look, but you know where you what to go. {items_obtained ? (Skeleton_Key, Combo) : You have all the pieces to unlock the door.}{items_obtained ? (Skeleton_Key) : You have a key and wire cutters, you could probably figure out how to get the door open with just that.}{items_obtained ? (Combo, Clippers) && items_obtained ?

You've searched almost the entire church, but there's not a lot of places left to look.}

You're close to the end of this, you can feel it. {Stay_Tracker >= 2.5: Your leg bounces and you stare at the front door. At the end of this... maybe... <br> <br> You shake the thought from your head.}
