        You open the door to find a small, mostly empty room. A slab of wood juts out from the far wall, creating an uncomfortable looking bench. A lumpy looking red cushion sits on top.

Under the bench, in the bucket, even wipeing away the cobwebs gathered in the corners.

            You plop onto lumpy cushion, and the door closes behind you. You stare at the intricate pattern on the door. If the heart is the church's weakness, it's not going to be left in the open or easy to find. There's no way to know if it even <i>exists.</i> There's no way of knowing if that voice was even really here to help you or just another trick of the church.

There's a splatter of blood just outside it, next to the ripped off piece of curtain. Scratch marks are etched into the wooden floor. Your flashlight shines on broken pieces of nail.

    "I'm sorry." You say, and she stops crying. "You're not in trouble, but..." You bite your lip.
    
    She coughs heavily before asking, "But what? Did I do something wrong? I- I just wanted to-"
    
    "You can't leave, not easily." You say, your voice quiet. You parrot back the same words that were said to you earlier. "{Confessional_Encounters ? (Finished_Curtain_Side): Your dad probably isn't here, or if he is, it's not him anymore.} Maybe together, we can-"

{Book_Knowledge ? (Read_Oldin_Book): "How do you know my name?" | "I thought you said he left?" }

You freeze. {Book_Knowledge ? (Read_Oldin_Book): Did she not say it earlier? | Why did you say that?} You think quickly on your feet. {Book_Knowledge ? (Read_Oldin_Book): You can't exactly tell her you read it in a book. }

{Book_Knowledge ? (Read_Oldin_Book): "He... thought you might visit! And... told me.... just in case!" | "He did... but told me where he went... just in case you visited!} It's pretty clear that you're lying, but you hope she buys it. 

"Oh." Her voice is quiet. "I see..."

*[Did she buy it?]

- "Then... If I tell you about—"

"Yes." you say, a little too fast.

"O—okay. I don't re—really know, but..." she clears her throat. "Daddy said one day he found a new job close to home. He wanted me to come visit so they could pray for me."

"They?" Your heart pounds.

"I dunno. Other people who come here? But after he went for the first time, he didn't come back. But he called a lot! He just really wanted me to come visit."

You ball your fists. It's not the same as what happened to you, but it's similar enough.

*[They are also victims of the church.]

- "Thank you." You say, and lean back, closing your eyes. Your mind races as you process the information. What do you and this girl, no <i>family</i>, have in common? "That helps a lot."

"Mhm... Where's my dad?" She is hopeful.

*[Lie to her]
    You don't think it matters. You know she's already gone, but it still feels bad to lie. You hope she forgives you. "He went to his office to finish a few things. If you wait by the door, he'll come find you."
    
    #PLAY: curtain
    "Okay, I'll... I'll do that." She sniffs, and the curtain opens. "Thank you."
    
    The curtain closes, and she is gone.
    
    **[Leave the booth]
    
    -- You didn't find the heart, but at least you learned a bit more about the church. You hope it will help you later.

- You don't think it matters, but you can't leave this girl to be digested, even if she's already gone. You think back to how you got out as a child, though it's still fuzzy.

"Your dad's gone, and you need to leave as well. Stay by the door, and it might let you out."

"What?" You don't answer, instead, you stand up and open the door. She starts coughing. "But you said-"

You don't hesitate and leave the booth. You stare at the confessional. It's quiet. You're not sure what's in there, but you don't think it's the same person that helped you before.

There was nothing in there, anyway. You should look for the heart elsewhere for now. You look...
