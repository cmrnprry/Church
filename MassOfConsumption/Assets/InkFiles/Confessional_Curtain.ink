    Your fingers brush against the key again when a cold hand grabs your arm. You jerk away, but it holds tight, fingers digging into your wrist.

    "The more you fight, the sweeter the meal you will be." The gruff voice from earlier growls. It's scratchy and low. "Don't mistake this for kindness."

    Something cold and metal is pressed into your palm, and you're released. You yank your arm back through the opening, falling into the opposite side. Your arm throbs where the thing grabbed you. In your hand is the key.
    
    The booth is quiet, save for your own breathing. You place the key in your pocket.

    The church fixed itself.

    The rapid drips from the leak stop. "You must be mistaken." The voice laughs, an angry and cruel laugh. "You <i>do</i> want to be here. You're just a bit confu—"
    ->Confessional_Curtain.Reject("how am I confused?")

- The leak is dripping faster now. The bucket is spilling over. The viscous liquid contains small bubbles as it crawls over the floor.

"Tell me, has the church ever harmed you?" the voice envelops you. Has the church harmed you? You find yourself doubting your memory. "Hmm?"

"I..."

{
    - leave_light:
    *[The church was angry..."]
        "It screamed at me. It— It burned me..." You shutter at the memory. 
        
        The rapid drips from the leak stop. "Angry...?" The voice laughs. "You must just be <i>confused</i>. The church would never—"
            
        {stay <= 1: A sudden surge of anger coursed through you. Confused? How were you just confused when— | You shake your head in disbelief. }

"When it brought you here, that must have been frightening. Change always is."

You nod.

<i>Plink! Plink! Plink!</i>

The liquid crawls towards your shoes. You don't think it's water at all. 

"All the church wants is to give you more than the world out there." You nod. "The church only wants the best for you. So, just. Stop. Fighting. It."

*You nod.

#PLAY: key-thrown
<i>Plunk!</i>

A small key falls into the bucket, causing the bucket to fall over, and the liquid to spill onto the floor. You lift your feet to avoid your shoes from soaking through, and the liquid stretches like you stepped in gum. Is this...? You gag.

"A gift for you. An olive branch of sorts." You hear the door close, and you know you are alone.

*[Pick up the key]

- You grab it out of the pool of liquid. It's sticky and thick, almost like... Your stomach churns. Saliva?

You wipe the key off using the confessional curtain, and stick it in your pocket. You look at the grate the voice spoke to you through. 

You wonder if you'll meet it again.

*[Return to your search]

Something clicks into place. "I... know who you are..."

"Do you now?" he laughs coldly.

"You're the father of—"

"The church. I do not have all day, and there are others waiting their turn." His voice is short and strained. "So this is the last time I'll ask you this: What. Do. You. Wish. To. Confess?"

#REPLACE: push the matter
You frown, "No, that's not what—" A gutter growl cuts you off. You don't think you should [push the matter]. The voice is pushing you to confess, maybe you can learn more if you play along?

You take a deep breath. You need to confess something? Fine. {stay < 1: He never said you have to say anything useful. You'll say enough to satisfy him and then push for more answers. | It might help you get some things off your chest. This could be... theraputic. You can push for answers later. }

    #PLAY: curtain
    Without a second thought, you rush out of the booth. You stare at the confessional. It's quiet. You're not sure what's in there, but you do know that you don't want to speak to it, let alone confess.
            
    There was nothing in there, anyway. You should look for the heart elsewhere for now. 
    ->Confessional_Curtain.Leave_NoProgress

- "No, the father of that girl."

#PLAY: groaning-angry, 2
The growl comes from the other side again. "I have no daughter." He says through gritted teeth.

"I talked to—"

"No one."

"She misses—"

"Who?"

An ear piecing shriek fills the booth{leave_light:, much worse than the one from before. | .} You plug your ears, but it makes no difference.

Bang!

The wood divider splinters a bit as whatever is on the other side slams into it. "Shut up shut up shut up SHUT UP" It's voice contorts and stretches as it changes from something human to something gutteral and monsterous.

*[Lunge for the curtain]

You slam into solid wood. The curtain's gone. The walls close in on you as you push yourself against them.

The divider between you is barely holding up. The wood is splinters while that- that <i>thing</i> shouts and curses you.

"I hate hate hate hate hate HATE you. You DARE speak of things you don't understand?!"

Bang!

The divider splits and falls, revealing the thing on the other side. You fall to the floor and push yourself against the wall, trying to get as far away as yuo possibly can.

*[You can't... What is...]

- It takes a step into your booth, impossibly tall. Impossibly long. It bends, folding in on itself in an attempt to fit in the small space. Your eyes can't accept what they're seeing. 

#CYCLE: hands, claws, tentacles, paws, fins
It has no legs except when it does. Deer hooves that disappear as soon as they touch the ground, only to be replaced with it's next step, like a cascading waterfall of hooves. It grabs the edge of the booth with its @. A human hand morphing into a infinitely splitting claw morphing into a feathered limb that curls and grabs anything within reach.

It says something that reverberates inside your brain. Words that hold meaning you understand, but can't explain. Changing your thoughts, your feelings. Something wet sharply forces your face up, and your eyes lock on it's face. It's true face.

*[A single tear rolls down your cheek.]
