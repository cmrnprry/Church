A small key falls into the bucket, causing the bucket to fall over, and the liquid to spill onto the floor. You lift your feet to avoid your shoes from soaking through, and the liquid streches like you stepped in gum. Is this...? You gag.

You wipe the key off using the confessional curtain, and stick it in your pocket. You look at the grate the voice spoke to you through. 

You wonder if you'll meet it again.

"The church is scary at first, but all change is. The church doesn't bring you here without reason." The voice is calming. It makes sense. Why else would you be here? "It would never hurt you."

- The leak is dripping faster now. The bucket is spilling over. The viscous liquid contains small bubbles as it crawls over the floor.

"Tell me, has the church ever harmed you?" the voice envlops you. Has the church harmed you? You find yourself doubting your memory. "Hmm?"

"I..."

    *[The church was angry..."]
    "It screamed at me. It- It burned me..." You shutter at the memory. 
    
    The rapid drips from the leak stop. "Angry...?" The voice laughs. "You must be mistaken. The church would never-"

<i>Plink! Plink! Plink!</i>

The liquid crawls towards your shoes. You don't think it's water at all. 

"All the church wants is to give you more than the world out there." You nod. "The church only wants the best for you. So, just. Stop. Fighting. It."

*You nod.

#PLAY: key-thrown
<i>Plunk!</i>

A small key falls into the bucket, causing the bucket to fall over, and the liquid to spill onto the floor. You lift your feet to avoid your shoes from soaking through, and the liquid streches like you stepped in gum. Is this...? You gag.

"A gift for you. An olive branch of sorts." You hear the door close, and you know you are alone.

*[Pick up the key]

- You grab it out of the pool of liquid. It's sticky and thick, almost like... Your stomach churns. Saliva?

You wipe the key off using the confessional curtain, and stick it in your pocket. You look at the grate the voice spoke to you through. 

You wonder if you'll meet it again.

You don't think you will get an answer. The voice is pushing you to confess.

You take a deep breath. You need to confess something? Fine.

#PLAY: curtain
You quickly leave the booth, and stare at the confessional. It's quiet. Whatever is in there, it won't tell you anything important. And you don't like that it was pushing you to "confess."
    
There was nothing in there, anyway. You should look for the heart elsewhere for now. You look...

Something clicks into place. "I... know who you are..."

"Do you now?" he laughs coldly.

"You're the father of-"

"The church. I do not have all day, and there are others waiting their turn." His voice is short. "So this is the last time I'll ask you this: What. Do. You. Wish. To. Confess?"

You frown, "No, that's not what-" A gutter growl cuts you off. You don't think you should [[push the matter]]. The voice is pushing you to confess, maybe you can learn more if you play along?

You take a deep breath. You need to confess something? Fine.

#PLAY: curtain
Without a second thought, you rush out of the booth. You stare at the confessional. It's quiet. You're not sure what's in there, but you do know that you don't want to speak to it, let alone confess.
        
There was nothing in there, anyway. You should look for the heart elsewhere for now. You look...

The growl comes from the otherside again. "I have no daughter." He says through gritted teeth.

"I talked to-"

"No one."

"She misses-"

"Who?"

The wood divider splinters a bit as whatever is on the otherside slams into it. "Shut up shut up shut up SHUT UP" His voice warms and contorts into something non-human.

The divider between you is barely holding up. The wood is splinters while that- that _thing_ shouts and curses you.

"I hate hate hate hate hate HATE you. You DARE speak of things you don't understand?!"

Bang!

The divder splits and falls, revealing the thing on the other side. You fall to the floor and push yourself against the wall, trying to get as far away as yuo possibly can.

*[You can't... What is...]

- It takes a step into your booth, impossibly tall. Impossibly long. Your eyes can't accept what they're seeing. 

It has no legs except when it does. Deer hooves that disappear as soon as they step down, only to replaced with a newer one with it's next step, like a cascading waterfall of legs. It grabs the edge of the booth with its  <hands, claws, tentacles, paws, wings>. A human hand morphing into a infinitiely splitting claw morphing into a featherd limb that curls and grabs anything within reach.

It says something that reverberates inside your brain. Words that hold meaning you understand in a way that you can't explain. Changing your thoughts, your feelings. Something wet sharply forces your face up, and your eyes lock on it's face. It's true face.

*A single tear rolls down your cheek.

*You've never known solace like this.
