#play: curtain
You sit on the cold wooden bench. Just like the outside, the inside doesn't have many details. The grate that a priest would speak through has the same lattice work that the door does. 

A small bucket sits in the corner by the divider. You assume the booth must leak, but the bucket is empty.

There is nothing remotely resembling the heart in here. What were you expecting? Why did you enter?

*[To Confess]
~temp_bool = true
"What is it you have to confess?" You jump at the deep voice comes from the other side of the screen. "I am here to listen."

*[To Look for Clues]
~temp_bool = false
You look around the small space again, touching the smooth wood to find anything your eyes might miss.

"Looking for something?" You jump at the deep voice comes from the other side of the screen. "I may be able to help?"

*[You Don't Know]
~temp_bool = false
"Lost are we?" You jump at the deep voice comes from the other side of the screen. "Maybe I can help?"

- Your heart races, and your entire body tenses. Another person? Here? Do they know about the heart? Can you trust them? 

*["Have you seen a heart?"]

"I cannot say I have." he chuckles. "Unless you mean your own? Maybe a confession would help you find it?"

    - temp_bool: "I will ask again: What is it you have to confess?"
    - else: "Do you have something to confess?"
}

*[Leave the booth]
#play: curtain
You quickly leave the booth, and stare at the confessional. It's quiet. You're not sure what's in there, but you do know that you don't want to speak to it.
    
There was nothing in there, anyway. You should look for the heart elsewhere for now. You look...

#play: curtain
You quickly leave the booth, and stare at the confessional. It's quiet. Whatever is in there, it won't tell you anything important. And you don't like that it was pushing you to "confess."
    
There was nothing in there, anyway. You should look for the heart elsewhere for now. You look...

Something clicks into place. "I... know who you are..."

"Do you now?" he laughs coldly.

"You're the father of-"

"The church. I do not have all day, and there are others waiting their turn." His voice is short. "So this is the last time I'll ask you this: What. Do. You. Wish. To. Confess?"

You frown, "No, that's not what-" A gutter growl cuts you off. You don't think you should [[push the matter]]. The voice is pushing you to confess, maybe you can learn more if you play along?

You take a deep breath. You need to confess something? Fine.

#play: curtain
Without a second thought, you rush out of the booth. You stare at the confessional. It's quiet. You're not sure what's in there, but you do know that you don't want to speak to it, let alone confess.
        
There was nothing in there, anyway. You should look for the heart elsewhere for now. You look...

- "No, the father of that girl."

The growl comes from the otherside again. "I have no daughter." He says through gritted teeth.

"I talked to-"

"No one."

"She misses-"

"Who?"

    - name: "EMILY!"
    - else: "Your DAUGHTER!"

The wood divider splinters a bit as whatever is on the otherside slams into it. "Shut up shut up shut up SHUT UP" His voice warms and contorts into something non-human.

The divider between you is barely holding up. The wood is splinters while that- that _thing_ shouts and curses you.

"I hate hate hate hate hate HATE you. You DARE speak of things you don't understand?!"

The divder splits and falls, revealing the thing on the other side. You fall to the floor and push yourself against the wall, trying to get as far away as yuo possibly can.

*[You can't... What is...]

- It takes a step into your booth, impossibly tall. Impossibly long. Your eyes can't accept what they're seeing. 

It has no legs except when it does. Deer hooves that disappear as soon as they step down, only to replaced with a newer one with it's next step, like a cascading waterfall of legs. It grabs the edge of the booth with its  <hands, claws, tentacles, paws, wings>. A human hand morphing into a infinitiely splitting claw morphing into a featherd limb that curls and grabs anything within reach.

It says something that reverberates inside your brain. Words that hold meaning you understand in a way that you can't explain. Changing your thoughts, your feelings. Something wet sharply forces your face up, and your eyes lock on it's face. It's true face.

*A single tear rolls down your cheek.

*You've never known solace like this.
